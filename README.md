# Handak-Lbelgha
A little funny game made with scratch.

This is my first game made with scratch, scratch is simple indeed, this little project took only the afternoon.

The rule of the game: hit the foe with your "belgha" using space key, but only if the foe rise his hand with the intention to hit you, else you will be disqualified, have fun!
